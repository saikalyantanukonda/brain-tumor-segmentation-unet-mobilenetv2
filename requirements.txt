The required dependencies for running the provided Jupyter notebook (munet1.ipynb) for UMobileNetV2 brain tumor segmentation are listed below, based on all imported libraries and standard environment needs for TensorFlow-based medical image segmentation with data augmentation, plotting, and image I/O.

## requirements.txt

```txt
tensorflow==2.13.0
keras==2.13.1
numpy>=1.21.0
opencv-python>=4.5.5
scikit-learn>=1.0.2
matplotlib>=3.4.3
pickle5>=0.0.11
```

### Notes

- Versions are compatible with current TensorFlow 2.x and Keras.
- "pickle5" is included for potential compatibility with older Python versions if needed.
- "glob" and "os" are Python standard libraries and do not require separate installation.[1]
- If using a Jupyter environment:
  ```
  jupyterlab>=3.0.0
  ```
- For environments without GPU, no extra requirements; for GPU support, additional CUDA/cuDNN specifics may be required.

This configuration enables loading/preprocessing MRI images, model building/training with MobileNetV2, plotting results, and saving/loading models and outputs.
